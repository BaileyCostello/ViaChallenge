# ViaChallenge
A small showcase of some front-end web design and development.

	The Process:
	
	I started by asking myself what goals Via has for a home page. Without industry research or data to fall back on,
	I  assumed that users would be grouped into passengers, drivers, and partners based on a content analysis of top 
	competetors: Uber and Lyft, as well as the Via homepage indicating that Via partnered with other businesses. 
	To limit scope, I chose to focus on passengers; I added in separate "links" for the other types of users. Again, 
	without any real data, in an attempt to  get a better idea of what should be provided on the Via homepage I 
	interviewed my boyfriend; an old fashioned kind of a guy who does not have much experience with these types of 
	applications. I asked four questions: 
		1. What forms of public transit have you used in the past?
		2. How would you define ride-sharing?
		3. You've just downloaded the Via app, what do you expect the steps are for you to get from point A to B? 
		4. What concerns do you have with public transportation?
	Questions 1 and 2 focus on users having and understanding of the via platform. Questions 3 and 4 focus on user pain points. 

	Before I looked at the current Via homepage, I went through the exercise of rapid-fire paper wireframing. I find this to help me come 
	up with lots of ideas in a short period of time. I came up with very similar ideas for content as the current Via homepage; mainly
	providing information that helps people understand what exactly Via is and does - due to it being an execution of a newer idea. 

	The composition was created with the words of my previous UX mentor in mind - take away as much content and color as you
	can until it no longer makes sense. 

	Finally, I mocked up an HTML file, attempting to showcase a little bit of my range of knowledge - including the Google API for JQuery
	as well as including files locally, a mobile responsive design, interaction, good coding practices and classic CSS and HTML.
